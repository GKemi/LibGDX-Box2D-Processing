# LibGDX-Box2D-Processing

This project is a wrapper for the [LibGDX Box2D library](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Box2d), which can be used for easily converting between the coordinate systems of the Processing and Box2D libraries.

This is an almost identical copy of what [Daniel Shiffman originally wrote for JBox2D](https://github.com/shiffman/Box2D-for-Processing), so all credit goes to him!
