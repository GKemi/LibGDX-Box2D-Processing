# LibGDX-Box2D-Processing

This project is a wrapper for the LibGDX Box2D library, which can be used for easily converting between the coordinate systems of the Processing and Box2D libraries.

This is an almost identical copy of what Daniel Shiffman originally wrote for JBox2D, so all credit goes to him!
